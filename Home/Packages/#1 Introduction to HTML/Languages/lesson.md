## HTML Definition

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create and structure the content of web pages.

## HTML Page Structure

The basic structure of an HTML page includes the `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags, each having a specific role in defining and displaying the content of the page.

## Content Markup

HTML uses tags to define various content elements such as paragraphs, headings, lists, links, images, etc.

## Tag Syntax

The basic syntax of HTML tags consists of an opening tag, optional content, and a closing tag (e.g., `<p>Content</p>`).

## HTML Attributes

HTML attributes provide additional information about HTML elements, such as the `src` attribute for `<img>` tags or the `href` attribute for `<a>` tags.

## HTML Content Rendering

HTML content is interpreted by the web browser to display web pages in a structured and aesthetic manner.

## Browser Compatibility

HTML tags are generally interpreted similarly by all modern web browsers, though there may be minor differences in display.

## HTML's Role in Web Development

HTML serves as the foundation of every web page and is often combined with other web technologies such as CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for styling and JavaScript for interactivity.

## HTML Evolution

HTML has evolved from its initial version to the current versions (HTML5), introducing new features and enhancements over time.

## Resources to Learn HTML

Additional resources, tutorials, documentation, and online communities are available to help learners deepen their understanding of HTML.

You can, for example, visit [OpenClassroom](https://openclassrooms.com/) to practice and discover more details about the HTML language.
