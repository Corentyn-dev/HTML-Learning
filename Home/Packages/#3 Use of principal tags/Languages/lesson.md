# Using Main Tags in HTML

## Table of Contents
1. [Tag `<html>`](#tag-html)
2. [Tag `<head>`](#tag-head)
3. [Tag `<body>`](#tag-body)

## Tag `<html>`
The `<html>` tag is the root tag of any HTML document. All other HTML elements must be contained within this tag. It typically contains two other main tags: `<head>` and `<body>`.

---

## Tag `<head>`
The `<head>` tag contains metadata about the HTML document, such as the page title, links to CSS style sheets, JavaScript scripts, meta tags, etc. It doesn't display any visible content to the user on the web page. Instead, it's used to provide information to the browser on how to process and render the page.

## Tag `<body>`
The `<body>` tag contains all the visible content of the web page, including text, images, links, videos, etc. This is where the majority of the page content is placed and displayed to the user.

By using these main tags appropriately, you can create a well-organized HTML structure that allows browsers to correctly render your content and provide a consistent user experience.
