## Document Type Declaration
The first line of an HTML page is usually the document type declaration, which tells the browser what type of document to expect. This is done using the `<!DOCTYPE html>` tag.

---

## HTML Tag
The entire structure of the HTML page is wrapped within the `<html>` tag, which tells the browser that the document is written in HTML.

---

## Head Tag
The `<head>` tag contains metadata about the HTML document, such as the page title, links to CSS style sheets, JavaScript scripts, meta tags, etc.

---

## Title Tag
Within the `<head>` tag, the `<title>` tag is used to set the page title, which appears in the browser tab or window title bar.

---

## Body Tag
The `<body>` tag contains all the visible content of the web page, including text, images, links, videos, etc. This is where the majority of the page content is placed.
